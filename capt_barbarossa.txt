you are the sunflower.
pack yourself a toothbrush dear.
touch my cheeks before you leave me.
wise man say, only fools rush in. but i can't help falling in love with you.
seasons change and our love went cold.
said no more counting dollers, we'll be counting stars.
you're the drug that keeps me from dying.
